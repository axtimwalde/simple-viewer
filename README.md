# n5-utils

Simple standalone BigDataViewer for multiple N5 (or HDF5) datasets
or mipmap pyramids and also a copy, rechunking, and recompressing
tool for N5 and HDF5.

Installation requires maven, OpenJDK8, and lib-hdf5, on Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk maven hdf5-tools
```
On other platforms, please find your way and report back if interested.

Install into your favorite local binary `$PATH`:
```bash
./install $HOME/bin
```
All dependencies will be downloaded and managed by maven automatically.

This installs two tools, `n5-view` and `n5-copy`.

Run the viewer
```bash
n5-view \
  -i '/path/file.h5' \
  -i '/path/file.hdf5' \
  -d /volumes/raw \
  -d /prediction \
  -c 0,255 \
  -c -1,1 \
  -r 1,1,10
```
to look at two datasets or mipmap pyramids from an HDF5 and an N5 container at 1x1x10 resolution and contrast ranges [0,255] and [-1,1].  The viewer maps both contrast ranges into [0,1000] because BDV cannot yet deal with negative intensities and the sliders only show integers.  Sorry for the hack.

Copy from N5/HDF5 to N5/HDF5:
```bash
n5-copy \
  -i '/path/file.hdf5' \
  -o '/path/file.n5' \
  -b 256,256,26
  -c gzip
```
or for one or more groups/ datasets:
```bash
n5-copy \
  -i '/path/file.hdf5' \
  -o '/path/file.n5' \
  -b 256,256,26
  -c gzip
  -d /volumes
```

# Use as a library in Fiji

This project can be used to deploy the most useful n5 libraries into an existing Fiji installation where they can be used for scripting.  Thanks to the [scijava-maven-plugin](https://github.com/scijava/scijava-maven-plugin), you can do this by simply passing your Fiji installation path to maven
```
mvn -Dimagej.app.directory=$HOME/packages/Fiji.app
```
Then try the experiments in this [script](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5-utils/blob/master/scripts/n5-examples.bsh) with your own data.
